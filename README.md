# GenAUI - AI-Driven UI Generation for Android

## 🚀 Overview

GenAUI is a cutting-edge framework for Android that enables AI-driven UI generation using Jetpack Compose. The framework allows AI models to dynamically create beautiful, native Android UIs by describing components and their properties in a structured format.

## 🚧 Project Status

**Work in Progress** - GenAUI is currently under active development. The core architecture and functionality are being refined and expanded. Stay tuned for a release demo coming soon!

## ✨ Features

- **AI-Driven UI Generation** - Create complex UIs based on simple AI instructions
- **Dynamic Component Rendering** - Render UI components on-the-fly from JSON descriptions
- **Type-Safe Component Registry** - Securely register and manage UI components
- **Annotation Processing** - Reduce boilerplate with KSP-powered code generation
- **Composable-First Architecture** - Built around Jetpack Compose for modern UI development

## 🏗️ Architecture

GenAUI implements a custom Jetpack Compose architecture centered around a Component Registry pattern with annotation processing:

1. **Component Registry** - Central system that maps component names to their implementations
2. **Annotation Processing** - Automated component registration using KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)
3. **Dynamic Rendering** - Runtime interpretation of AI-generated UI descriptions
4. **Prop Mapping** - Type-safe conversion of JSON properties to Composable parameters



This architecture provides a secure sandbox for AI-generated UIs while maintaining the performance and flexibility of native Android applications.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Kotlin** - 100% Kotlin codebase
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern declarative UI toolkit
- **KSP** - Kotlin Symbol Processing for annotation-based code generation
- **AI Integration** - Flexible integration with various AI models

## 🔍 Use Cases

- **Dynamic Content Creation** - Let AI generate UIs based on user needs
- **Personalized Experiences** - Create custom interfaces tailored to individual users
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Quickly generate and test different UI variations
- **Accessibility Adaptation** - Generate interfaces optimized for different accessibility needs
